                                <p>The zodiac is divided into 12 signs. The zodiac sign symbols each cover roughly the equivalent of a month's time. But unlike our calendar months, time for zodiac signs is calculated differently. 
                                The zodiac sign symbols each cover roughly the equivalent of a month's time. But unlike our calendar months, time for zodiac signs is calculated differently. This is because Western astrologists calculate the first sign based off the Northern hemisphere's vernal equinox (spring), which happens around March 21st every year. From there, the zodiac signs dates were set based off the dates of the sun's passage through the respective constellations during Ancient Greek times.
